## Hi, I'm Yann!
- I'm passionate about developing tools and methods to increase the impact of environmental and social policies.
- I previosuly worked as a Project Officer for the French Development Agency in Comoros, as well as a Research Officer at [CIRED](http://www.centre-cired.fr/en/).
- 👨‍🎓 I graduated in Applied Economics at the Paris School of Economics, and in Public Policy at Sciences Po
- 🛠 By rank of confidence, I speak R and Python, followed by ReactJS (hence HTML/CSS/Javascript)
- 💾 I work with NoSQL data, such as MongoDB and Neo4J, as well as with relational data.
- Feel free to reach out at [yann.collindavid@gmail.com](mailto:yann.collindavid@gmail.com)
- You can find further information about my ongoing projects at https://ydavid.fr/  (hold on, I need to update this page soon)
