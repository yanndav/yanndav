- 👋 Hi, I'm Yann!
- 🌍 I now work at the [CIRED](http://www.centre-cired.fr/en/) as a Research Officer on a very cool project: the [Biovallée](https://biovallee.net/). My task is to develop a monitoring tool (a dashboard) incorporating material flow analysis and socioeconomic indicators at a very local level.
- 🌱 On my spare time I'm also developping www.ecolometrics.org in partnership with [Gael](https://github.com/gael-david), an awesome brother and full-stack developper. The objective is to deploy an open knowledge hub on ecological transitions (by the end of 2021).
- 🛠 I speak R and Python, and I'm learning Html/CSS/Javascript/React
- 👨‍🎓 I am finalising / finalised my graduate studies in Applied Economics at the Paris School of Economics, and in Public Policy at Sciences Po
