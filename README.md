## Hi, I'm Yann!
-  I now work at the [CIRED](http://www.centre-cired.fr/en/) as a Research Officer on a very cool project: the [Biovallée](https://biovallee.net/). My task is to develop a monitoring tool (a dashboard) incorporating material flow analysis and socioeconomic indicators at a very local level.
- 🛠 By rank of confidence, I speak R and Python, and I'm also learning Html/CSS/Javascript/React
- 👨‍🎓 I am a graduate in Applied Economics at the Paris School of Economics, and in Public Policy at Sciences Po
- Feel free to reach out at [yann.collindavid@gmail.com](mailto:yann.collindavid@gmail.com)
