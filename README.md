## Hi, I'm Yann!
-  I work at the [CIRED](http://www.centre-cired.fr/en/) as a Research Officer. I've initiated and I develop a very cool project: [ecolometrix](https://ecolometrix.fr/). The objective is to create a platform where users can manipulate and visualise the french open data with no code.
- 🛠 By rank of confidence, I speak R and Python, followed by ReactJS (hence HTML/CSS/Javascript)
- 💾 I work with NoSQL data, such as MongoDB and Neo4J, as well as with SQL-like data.
- 👨‍🎓 I graduated in Applied Economics at the Paris School of Economics, and in Public Policy at Sciences Po
